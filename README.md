# Chess

You are required to create a program, which simulates a chessboard and the
movements of various types of pieces on the chessboard.

## Chessboard:

The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid with 64 cells in it.
With 8 rows (A, B, C.... H) and 8 columns (1, 2, 3.... 8), each cell can be uniquely
identified with its cell number. This can be seen illustrated below.


## Chess pieces and their movements:
The game of chess has 6 unique types of pieces, with their own unique types
of movements. These are:
1) *King* – Can move only 1 step at a time in all 8 directions (horizontal, vertical
and diagonal)
2) *Queen* – Can move across the board in all 8 directions
3) *Bishop* – Can move across the board only diagonally
4) *Horse* – Can move across the board only in 2.5 steps (2 vertical steps and 1
horizontal step)
5) *Rook* – Can move across the board only vertically and horizontally
6) *Pawn* – Can move only 1 step at a time, in the forward direction, vertically.
Can also move 1 step forward diagonally, in order to eliminate an opposing
piece.

## Objective of your program:
Your program should simulate the movement of each unique chess piece on an
empty chessboard.
* Input – The input string to your program will be the Type of chess piece and
its Position (cell number) on the chessboard. E.g. “King D5”
* Output – Once you execute the program, the output will be a string of all
possible cells in which the chess piece can move.

* Sample inputs and outputs:
Input – “King D5”
Output – “D6, E6, E5, E4, D4, C4, C5, C6”
